## Getting Started 
Click [here](https://chefdev.herokuapp.com/) to view a demo 


## Next Steps
- Allow users to upload a profile picture / image for their post
- Allow users to submit an ingredient
- Complete validations on sign up form so no two users can have the same email or username
- Implement the ability to load more posts on click 
- When updating a profile, show their previous profile inputs in the form fields instead of empty fields
- If a page doesn't exist show a custom error page, right now it just takes you to a blank page of that specific template - public profiles and posts 
- Sort and categorize posts and have them display on the sidebar depending on these categories
- Make the ingredients list on the main sidebar dynamic and when clicked you can view recipes with those ingredients
- Fix search bar functionality
- Right now the adding an image to a post was taken away because we weren't able to control the size of the image so if it was too big we would get an error - fix this
- Add the ability to edit a post
- On the users detail page show the ingredients they use - they are just hard coded in right now
- Create context for shared state instead of prop drilling for cleaner code
